# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project involves a complete analysis of COVID-19 data using Python. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and visualizations using standard data science libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at iStudio, held from May 2025 to July 2025. It served as a practical assignment to implement the fundamental concepts of data handling and visualization on a real-world dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available at the following URL:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SR1608/Datasets/main/covid-data.csv

## Objectives

- Load and understand the structure of the dataset  
- Perform both high-level and low-level data analysis  
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values and duplicates  
- Convert date fields and extract useful time-based features  
- Perform data aggregation and grouping operations  
- Engineer new features for deeper insights  
- Visualize trends and relationships using charts  

## Libraries and Tools Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  

## Key Highlights

- Filtered dataset to include only relevant columns for analysis  
- Removed missing and duplicate records  
- Converted date fields and extracted month values  
- Grouped data by continent and calculated statistical measures  
- Engineered a new feature: total_deaths_to_total_cases  
- Generated various plots: histograms, scatter plots, pair plots, and bar charts
